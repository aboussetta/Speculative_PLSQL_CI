# Speculative PLSQL Continuous Integration
Setting up and maintaining a continuous integration development environment for Oracle PLSQL is a fairly problematic and involved scenario for which solutions are rather sparse.  This repository attempts to describe a fairly simplistic and no doubt limited approach to PLSQL CI.  It works for me for a specific set of "DZ" utility modules and perhaps it could serve others or provide inspiration for your own solutions.

True database CI should involve a redeployment of the database and hosted data with each build.  Doing this type of thing in Oracle can often be unwieldy - particularly before the advent of pluggable databases in 12c.  While I remain very much interested in the topic of total CI builds in Oracle, this solution just addresses CI development of a small set of independent logic, mostly sets of  generic utility code which functions to support larger application logic.

A basic system diagram would be the following

#####Revision Control System
While my environment uses MS Team Foundation Server, essentially any RCS which your CI Server can poll for changes would work.  GitHub obviously would be a good choice.

#####Continuous Integration Server
[Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) is my CI server of choice.   Jenkins provides the key abilities to poll the RCS for changes, extract those changes, launch a job, execute Maven, email build issues to owners and archive and provide statistics on build history over time.  

#####Oracle Test Database
Obviously doing PLSQL testing needs a database in which to test the code.  Your CI Server will need jdbc or OCI drivers in order to access the test database.  Currently I route some of my testing through sqlplus and thus my Jenkins server has an Oracle client installed.

#####Maven
Most of the heavy lifting is done with Maven 3.  The CI Server job launches Maven using a custom project object model (pom.xml) file.  See a [sample pom.xml](/pom.xml) for how my tests run.  Maven results are recorded and success/failure tracked in the Jenkins job.

#####Natural Docs
As part of the Maven build process, the pom.xml concatenates the PLSQL code into a deployment script.  This script is then run through [Natural Docs](http://www.naturaldocs.org/) to create the deployment documentation as HTML.

#####HTML2PDF
The resulting HTML doc is then converted to PDF using [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

###Code Conventions and Restrictions
* The pom.xml assembles the PLSQL code in the order necessary to compile without errors.  If your code throws errors due to circular compilation issues, well then you'd need a more robust manner to check compilation success.<br/>

###Conclusions
The above solution may appear rather cobbled together but basically works okay for me within the limitation listed above.  It may or may not suite your coding and/or workflow.  I would appreciate it if you drop me a line with any thoughts or suggestions you have.
